[Verse]
Streetlights flicker like they're lost in time
Puddles ripple with a silent rhyme
My shadow stretches but it won't stay near

[Prechorus]
Footsteps echo where the world disappears
The rain whispers secrets only I can hear

[Chorus]
And I walk
And I wander
Through the rain tonight
Searching for the pieces of a faded light
Every drop
Every step
Feels like déjà vu
In this rainy city
It's just me and the blues

[Verse 2]
Neon reflections on the asphalt's skin
Windows hold stories I'll never get in
The sky keeps crying but it hides its face

[Prechorus]
Lonely corners and the cold embrace
The world slows down in this quiet space

[Chorus]
And I walk
And I wander
Through the rain tonight
Searching for the pieces of a faded light
Every drop
Every step
Feels like déjà vu
In this rainy city
It's just me and the blues
